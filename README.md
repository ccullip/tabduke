## TabDuke
A minimalistic dashboard for Duke Students.

=====
Features:
- BUS TIMES: uses the TransLoc API to display incoming bus arrivals at high traffic bus stops like Duke Chapel and East Campus.
- CAMPUS EATERIES: shows which on-campus restaurants are currently open. Hover over restaurants to see how long you have until closing time.
- FOOD TRUCKS: You can now see which food trucks are on campus for the current day!
- TODO LIST: You can now create your own to-do list, check off things you've done, and mark the important items! Find it in the info box on the top of your screen; it's the second panel.
- Pictures of our beautiful campus!

New in 2.3:
- Bug fixes.
- An even better icon for the settings menu.
- Some font size tweaks.

New in 2.2.1:
- Your links and settings will now be saved with Chrome sync! Now when you log in to chrome somewhere else, your settings will be loaded. Unfortunately this means you lose your current settings, but that shouldn't be hard to redo.
- Made the font size in the to-do list bigger, more readable
- Shrank the image file sizes, to optimize image rendering (no more waiting a couple seconds for the picture to fully load!). Extension is now only 7.3MB
- Changed the settings icon
- Dame's Express restaurant hours and menu added!
- Coming soon: EVENTS - Add your classes, assignments, etc. and have reminders show up in the info box!

New in 2.2:
- TODO LIST: You can now create your own to-do list, check off things you've done, and mark the important items! Find it in the info box on the top of your screen; it's the second panel.

New in 2.1:
- FOOD TRUCKS: You can now see which food trucks are on campus for the current day!
- Added 2 LaSalle Loop stops.
- Fixed Saladelia at Perkins hours.
